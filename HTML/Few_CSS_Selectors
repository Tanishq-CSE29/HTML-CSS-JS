Different types of selectors
When styling a web page, there are many types of selectors available that allow developers to be as broad or as specific as they need to be when selecting HTML elements to apply CSS rules to.
Here you will learn about some of the common CSS selectors that you will use as a developer.
<!-- Element Selectors -->
The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their element type.

For example, if you use p as the selector, the rule will apply to all p elements on the webpage.
HTML
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>In a hidden land...</p>

CSS
p{ 
  color: blue; 
}


<!-- ID Selectors -->
The ID selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element. Since the id is unique within a webpage, it allows the developer to select a specific element for styling. ID selectors are prefixed with a # character.

HTML
<span id="latest">New!</span>

CSS
#latest { 
  background-color: purple; 
}


<!-- Class Selectors -->
Elements can also be selected based on the class attribute applied to them. The CSS rule has been applied to all elements with the specified class name. The class selector is prefixed with a ".character".

In the following example, the CSS rule applies to both elements as they have the 'navigation' CSS class applied to them.

HTML
<a class="navigation">Go Back</a>
<p class="navigation">Go Forward</p>

CSS
.navigation { 
  margin: 2px;
}

<!-- Element with Class Selector -->
A more specific method for selecting HTML elements is by first selecting the HTML element, then selecting the CSS class or ID.
The example below selects all p elements that have the CSS class introduction applied to them.

HTML
<p class="introduction"></p>

CSS
p.introduction { 
  margin: 2px;
}


<!-- Descendant Selectors -->
Descendant selectors are useful if you need to select HTML elements that are contained within another selector.
Let's explore an example.

HTML
<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Archives</h1>

CSS
#blog h1 {
  color: blue;
}
The CSS rule will select all h1 elements that are contained within the element with the ID blog. The CSS rule will not apply to the h1 element containing the text Archives.

The structure of a descendant selector is a CSS selector, followed by a single space character, followed by another CSS selector.

Multiple descendants can also be selected. For example, to select all h1 elements that are descendants of div elements which are descendants of the blog element, the selector is specified as follows.

CSS
#blog div h1 {
  color: blue;
}


<!-- Child Selectors -->
Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent). For example, you have the following HTML structure:

HTML
<div id="blog">
  <h1>Latest News</h1>
  <div>
    <h1>Today's Weather</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
  </div>
  <p>Subscribe for more news</p>
</div>
If you wanted to style the h1 element containing the text Latest News, you can use the following child selector:

CSS
#blog > h1 {
  color: blue;
}

This will select the element with the ID blog (the parent), then it will select all h1 elements that are contained directly in that element (the children). The structure of the child selector is a CSS selector followed by the child combinator symbol > followed by another CSS selector.

Note that this will not go beyond a single depth level. Therefore, the CSS rule will not be applied to the h1 element containing the text Today's Weather.

<!-- :hover Pseudo-Class -->
A special keyword called a pseudo-class allows developers to select elements based on their state. Don't worry too much about what that means right now. For now, let's look at how the hover pseudo-class allows you to style an element when the mouse cursor hovers over the element.

The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. To do this, you add the :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector. In the following example, adding :hover  to the a element will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.

CSS
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}
This pseudo-class is very useful for creating visual effects based on user interaction.

<!-- TEXT -->
With CSS there are many ways to change how text is displayed.
In this section, you'll learn the most common text manipulation CSS properties.


<!-- Text Color -->
The color property sets the color of text. 
The following CSS sets the text color for all paragraph elements to red.

p{ 
  color: red;
}


<!-- Text Font and Size -->
There are many different fonts to display text on your computer.
In simple terms, font is a collection of text characters written in a specific style and size.
If you've used a word processor before, you're probably familiar with the fonts 'Times New Roman' and 'Calibri'.
To set the font used by text in CSS you use the font-family property.


p{ 
  font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
}
Since computers vary in what fonts they have installed, it is recommended to include several fonts when using the font-family property. 
These are specified in a fallback order, meaning that if the first font is not available, it will check for the second font.
If the second font is not available, then it will check for the third font and so on. 
If none of the fonts are available, it will use the browser's default font.

To set the size of the font, the font-size property is used.

p { 
  font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
  font-size: 12px;
}


<!-- Text Transformation -->
Text transformation is useful if you want to ensure the correct capitalization of the text content. In the example below, the CSS rule will change all text in paragraph elements to uppercase using the text-transform property:

p { 
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

The most commonly used values for the text-transform property are:  uppercase,  lowercase,  capitalize  and none.
The default value used is none, which means the text displays as it was written in the HTML document.


<!-- Text Decoration -->
The text-decoration property is useful to apply additional decoration to text such as underlining and line-through (strikethrough).

p { 
  text-decoration: underline;
}

It is possible to set the color, thickness and styling of the decoration too. 
In the example below, the underline will be a solid red line that is 5 pixels thick.

p { 
  text-decoration: underline red solid 5px;
}

If this is confusing, don't worry. 
These properties can be individually set using the text-decoration-line, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style and text-decoration-thickness properties. 
Let's use the same example again and define it using the individual properties:

p { 
  text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
  text-decoration-style: solid;
  text-decoration-thickness: 5px;
}
The most common text-decoration-line values used are: underline, overline, line-through and none. 
None is the default value to use no text decoration.
There are many styles available for the text-decoration-style  property;  solid,  double,  dotted,  dashed  and  wavy.
The text-decoration-style property requires the decoration line to be defined. If the decoration style is not specified, solid will be used.
